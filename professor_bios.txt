Biography I have been programming computers since I taught myself BASIC, using an HP-2000, in 1972. After that, it was Fortran, APL, Pascal, C, C++, Java, and C#, as well as numerous assemblers along the way. My undergraduate thesis involved collecting signals from a photomultiplier tube with a 7400-series TTL counter interface I designed and built (this was the subject of a short paper in the American Journal of Physics, co-authored by my advisor, Dr. Mark Petersen). My graduate thesis was on using segmented architecture machines to compute large synthetic images. As an attorney, a large part of my professional work for the last 25 years has been to assist other lawyers in understanding evidence recovered from computers, and to testify as an expert witness regarding that evidence. My primary area of interest now is in procedural modeling for run-time creation of three-dimensional environments for computer games.

Biography Benjamin B. Bederson is a Professor of Computer Science and prior director of the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies and iSchool at the University of Maryland. An ACM Distinguished Scientist, his research is on human computation, mobile device interfaces, interaction strategies, digital libraries, and digital education.  He is also Co-founder and Chief Scientist of Zumobi, a premium mobile app network.
He is well known for his work on Zoomable User Interfaces (ZUIs) since the mid-1990's including the Pad++ and Piccolo toolkits for zoomable and structured 2D graphics. That work led to his well known applications around personal photo management (PhotoMesa), calendaring (DateLens) and hierarchical data visualization (SpaceTree). ZUIs have since become well established in industry in a wide range of domains including maps and mobile phones. Ben is also well known for his work around children's educational technologies including his notable International Children's Digital Library (at www.childrenslibrary.org).
More recently, Ben has established himself in the areas of human computation and online education. Human Computation is an approach to combine human with computational effort to solve problems at a scale and quality that neither could accomplish alone. One important example of this work is his NSF and Google supported work on MonoTrans, a system that enables monolingual human speakers to collaboratively translate text. Online education connects to human computation because one of the essential challenges is in scaling up individualized instruction and instructor connections to and awareness of class activity.

Dr. Rytting is a computational linguist with prior work in corpus normalization and quality control, automatic cognate/loanword detection, and natural language processing for under-resourced languages and social media text.
Dr. Rytting led the development of the University of Maryland’s “Did You Mean…?” (DYM) tool, which supports error-tolerant search of lexical resources, and the related DYM toolkit, which allows non-programmers to develop error-tolerant lexical search capabilities for themselves. Dr. Rytting also served as the site Co-Principal Investigator for the UMD contribution to the testing and evaluation (T&E) team for the IARPA Babel program and as the Principal Investigator of a project normalizing speech transcriptions across dialects for colloquial Arabic.  He also served as PI for a project to collect a new corpus and develop language-specific features in social media text predictive of certain personality and cognitive traits.
Dr. Rytting is currently collaborating with Dr. Susannah Paletz (PI) and other University of Maryland researchers on a Minerva Research Initiative grant to study the role of emotional content and narrative in predicting the rate at which social media posts are shared. For more details on this project are available at Emotions in Social Media.
